  This file contains information not found in the Owner's Handbook,
  including how to get technical help, and a complete list of files on
  the distribution disk.  Since this file contains information
  important to you, please read it in its entirety; hopefully it will

1. HELP
-------
  If you need help with the Turbo Prolog Toolbox, please read this help
  file and the Owner's Handbook thoroughly.  The sample programs
  included on this diskette are also a good source of information about
  how to use the TOOLBOX.

  If you still have a question and need technical assistance, help is
  available from the following sources:

  1. Type GO BORPRO on the CompuServe bulletin board system.

     Borland technical support representatives can be reached on the
     Borland Programming Languages Forum on CompuServe.  For modem
     users, it's a convenient, powerful alternative to telephones or
     the mail.  Download information-packed files from the Data
     Libraries - RIGHT NOW - or post a message to "Sysop" and get a
     reply from a Borland technical support representative.

     If you're not a CompuServe user yet and want to know more, call or
     write:

        CompuServe
        Consumer Information Service
        5000 Arlington Centre Boulevard
        Columbus, OH 43220
        (800) 848-8199;  In Ohio, call (614) 457-0802

  2. Check with your local software dealer or user group.

  3. Write to: Borland International

     Note: Please include your serial number (located on the
           distribution disk), otherwise we will be unable to process
           your letter.

  4. If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait and you have sent
     in the license agreement from the front of your manual, you may
     call the Borland Technical Support Department.

  Please have the following information ready before calling:

  1. Your serial number (located on the front of your distribution
     disk) must be available; otherwise we will be unable to process
     your call.

  2. Product name and version number (The version number of this
     Toolbox is 1.0. The version number of TURBO PROLOG appears
     on the summary screen when the program is first loaded.)

  3. Computer name, model and the names and model numbers of any
     additional hardware.

  4. Operating system and version number (the version number can be
     determined by typing VER at any DOS prompt).

  5. Contents of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

  6. Contents of your CONFIG.SYS file.



2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
-------------------------

   OBJECT FILES FOR GRAPHICS PROJECTS

   The files GRAPHICS.OBJ and EGAGRAPH.OBJ are both included in
   graphics projects.  Since these files work as a unit, it is
   necessary to include EGAGRAPH.OBJ in your projects even if you
   do not have an EGA card.


   A GENERAL NOTE ON PROJECT FILES

   When Turbo Prolog compiles project (.PRJ) files, it takes the
   listed files, and will compile them from source code (.PRO)
   files into object (.OBJ) files.  In some cases the source code
   file has already been compiled to an object file, and
   therefore the .PRO file is not present.  In these instances,
   you will get a message during compilation that it is
   impossible to open this .PRO file.  This will not affect the
   successful compilation of the project file since Turbo Prolog
   will find the object file.

   Since Turbo Prolog overwrites the existing object file when
   compiling a source code file of the same name, it is a good
   idea to never create a Turbo Prolog source code file with the
   same name as any of the object tool files (SERIAL.OBJ,
   GRAPHICS.OBJ, PICTOOLS.OBJ, TICKS.OBJ, and EGAGRAPH.OBJ).  For
   example, if you created a file called GRAPHICS.PRO, you would
   receive an error when compiling a graphics project.


   SCREEN HANDLING PROGRAMS ON EGA MONOCHROME

   If you are running an EGA card with a monochrome monitor, some of
   the screen handling programs may not show up on your screen.  If you
   have this configuration, simply change the color parameters in the
   makewindow predicates to 7.


   LARGE PROGRAMS

   SCRDEF.PRO is large--it requires 512K to run.

   XCOMMU.PRJ and PARSER.PRJ may be too large to run within the Turbo Prolog
   environment. Compile the project to an .EXE file, quit Turbo Prolog and
   run the .EXE file from DOS.



4. CORRECTIONS TO THE MANUAL
----------------------------

Page 7:

Set up the following directories:

   PRO directory:    \B
   OBJ directory:    \B
   EXE directory:    \B
   TURBO directory:  \A

should be

   PRO directory:    B:\
   OBJ directory:    B:\
   EXE directory:    B:\
   TURBO directory:  A:\


Page 17:

   Last paragraph should read: "... choice parameter is an integerlist
   rather than an integer and InitItem is an integerlist rather than an
   integer...".

Page 23:

boxmenu example

      boxmenu(5,5,7,40..., CHOICE)

should be

      boxmenu(5,5,40,7..., Choice)


Page 24:

   3rd paragraph - ... list of INTEGERs(add '" and the starting items
   are highlighted according to the integerlist StListChoice'.")

Page 32:

   Change the database declaration
               treewindow(ROW,COL,ROW,COL,ROW,COL)

   to
               treewindow(ROW,COL)

   To use the treewindow tool, you must include the database
   declarations

           database
               treewindow(ROW,COL)
               treechoice(SELECTOR)

Page 97:

   The call to the predicate plot should not contain any flow pattern
   or language declaration.

Page 100:

   XGEOMTR.PRO should be XGEOMETR.PRO


Page 126:

   In defining a call to loadpic, Filename should be FileName.

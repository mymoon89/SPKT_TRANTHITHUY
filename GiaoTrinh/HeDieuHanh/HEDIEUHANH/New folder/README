This patch includes a new version of TLINK ( version 522b ) which
increases the capacity of the linker. Use this version of TLINK if
experiencing TABLE LIMIT EXCEEDED. Also, this TLINK will produce a
properly sorted MAP file to be used by TMAPSYM to avoid the error:
"Symbol addresses are in non-ascending order". To apply this patch,
save the current file, borlandc\bin\tlink.exe, for backup, and replace
with TLINK.EXE from this patch. This version of TLINK may be of
benefit to any previous versions experiencing Table Limit Exceeded.

&item29=Index #An index creates a logical order for the data rows in the table. This assists in faster location and retrieval of data during searches.&
&item30=Index statistics #It provides information about the distribution of values in a column or a group of columns. The query optimizer uses index statistics to speed up the query process.&
&item31=Indexed views #A view that has a unique clustered index created on it.&
&item32=INSERT trigger #It executes when a new record is inserted in a table.&
&item33=Inserted table #It contains copies of records that are modified with the INSERT and UPDATE operations on the trigger table. It does not physically remain present in the database. It is created and dropped by triggering events.&
&item34=INSTEAD OF trigger #It executes in place of the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations. It can be created on tables as well as views.&
&item35=Local stored procedure #Local stored procedures are created in individual user databases.&
&item36=Lock granularity #It is referred as the levels at which locks are applied depending on individual updating requirements.&

&item40=Parameters #Parameters are used to pass data between stored procedures and the application that calls the procedures.&
&item41=Partitioning #Feature that splits a structure into smaller units. This enables you to access data quickly and efficiently. Maintenance operations on subsets of data are performed more efficiently because they target only the required subset of data instead of the entire table.&
&item42=Partitioned view #A view created using horizontally partitioned data from one or more tables.&
&item43=Partition function #It partitions a table depending upon the values in the columns.& 
&item44=Partition scheme #It identifies the file-groups to store each partition.&
&item45=PATH XML index #It executes queries that include XML path expression.&
&item46=PRIMARY KEY constraint #It checks for uniqueness of data in a column and disallows duplicate values to be entered in that column.&
&item47=PROPERTY XML index #It executes queries that require object properties from the XML document.&
&item48=Return code #The procedure performs the required task using these values and, by default, returns a zero or non-zero integer.&
